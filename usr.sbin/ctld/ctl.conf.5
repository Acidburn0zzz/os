.Ss global level
The following statements are available at the global level:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic auth-group Aq Ar name
Opens an auth-group section, defining an authentication group,
which can then be assigned to any number of targets.
.It Ic debug Aq Ar level
Specifies debug level.
The default is 0.
.It Ic maxproc Aq Ar number
Specifies limit for concurrently running child processes handling
incoming connections.
The default is 30.
Setting it to 0 disables the limit.
.It Ic pidfile Aq Ar path
Specifies path to pidfile.
The default is
.Pa /var/run/ctld.pid .
.It Ic portal-group Aq Ar name
Opens a portal-group section, defining a portal group,
which can then be assigned to any number of targets.
.It Ic lun Ar name
Create a
.Sy lun
configuration context, defining a LUN to be exported by some target(s).
.It Ic target Ar name
Create a
.Sy target
configuration context, which can contain one or more
.Sy lun
contexts.
.It Ic timeout Ar seconds
The timeout for login sessions, after which the connection
will be forcibly terminated.
The default is 60.
Setting it to 0 disables the timeout.
.It Ic isns-server Ar address
An IPv4 or IPv6 address and optionally port of iSNS server to register on.
.It Ic isns-period Ar seconds
iSNS registration period.
Registered Network Entity not updated during this period will be unregistered.
The default is 900.
.It Ic isns-timeout Ar seconds
Timeout for iSNS requests.
The default is 5.
.El
.Ss auth-group level
The following statements are available at the auth-group level:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic auth-type Ao Ar type Ac
Specifies authentication type.
Type can be either "none", "deny", "chap", or "chap-mutual".
In most cases it is not neccessary to set the type using this clause;
it is usually used to disable authentication for a given auth-group.
.It Ic chap Ao Ar user Ac Aq Ar secret
Specifies CHAP authentication credentials.
.It Ic chap-mutual Ao Ar user Ac Ao Ar secret Ac Ao Ar mutualuser Ac Aq Ar mutualsecret
Specifies mutual CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that for any auth-group, configuration may contain either chap,
or chap-mutual entries; it's an error to mix them.
.It Ic initiator-name Ao Ar initiator-name Ac
Specifies iSCSI initiator name.
If not defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator
name.
Otherwise, only initiators with names matching one of defined
ones will be allowed to connect.
.It Ic initiator-portal Ao Ar address Ac Ao Ar / prefixlen Ac
Specifies the iSCSI initiator portal: an IPv4 or IPv6 address, optionally
followed by slash and prefix length.
If not defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator
address.
Otherwise, only initiators with addresses matching one of defined
ones will be allowed to connect.
.El
.Ss portal-group level
The following statements are available at the portal-group level:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic discovery-auth-group Aq Ar name
Assigns previously defined authentication group to the portal group,
to be used for target discovery.
By default, portal groups are assigned predefined
.Sy auth-group
.Qq Ar default ,
which denies discovery.
Another predefined
.Sy auth-group ,
.Qq Ar no-authentication ,
may be used
to permit discovery without authentication.
.It Ic discovery-filter Ar filter
Determines which targets are returned during discovery.
Filter can be either
.Qq Ar none ,
.Qq Ar portal ,
.Qq Ar portal-name ,
or
.Qq Ar portal-name-auth .
When set to
.Qq Ar none ,
discovery will return all targets assigned to that portal group.
When set to
.Qq Ar portal ,
discovery will not return targets that cannot be accessed by the
initiator because of their
.Sy initiator-portal .
When set to
.Qq Ar portal-name ,
the check will include both
.Sy initiator-portal
and
.Sy initiator-name .
When set to
.Qq Ar portal-name-auth ,
the check will include
.Sy initiator-portal ,
.Sy initiator-name ,
and authentication credentials.
The target is returned if it does not require CHAP authentication,
or if the CHAP user and secret used during discovery match those
used by the target.
Note that when using
.Qq Ar portal-name-auth ,
targets that require CHAP authentication will only be returned if
.Sy discovery-auth-group
requires CHAP.
The default is
.Qq Ar none .
.It Ic listen Ar address
An IPv4 or IPv6 address and port to listen on for incoming connections.
.\".It Ic listen-iser Ar address
.\"An IPv4 or IPv6 address and port to listen on for incoming connections
.\"using iSER (iSCSI over RDMA) protocol.
.It Ic offload Ar driver
Define iSCSI hardware offload driver to use for this
.Sy portal-group .
.It Ic redirect Ar address
IPv4 or IPv6 address to redirect initiators to.
When configured, all initiators attempting to connect to portal
belonging to this
.Sy portal-group
will get redirected using "Target moved temporarily" login response.
Redirection happens before authentication and any
.Sy initiator-name
or
.Sy initiator-portal
checks are skipped.
.El
.Ss target level:
The following statements are available at the target level:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic alias Aq Ar text
Assigns human-readable description to the target.
There is no default.
.It Ic auth-group Aq Ar name
Assigns previously defined authentication group to the target.
By default, targets that do not specify their own auth settings,
using clauses such as "chap" or "initiator-name", are assigned
predefined auth-group "default", which denies all access.
Another predefined auth-group, "no-authentication", may be used to permit access
without authentication.
.It Ic auth-type Ao Ar type Ac
Specifies authentication type.
Type can be either "none", "deny", "chap", or "chap-mutual".
In most cases it is not neccessary to set the type using this clause;
it is usually used to disable authentication for a given target.
This clause is mutually exclusive with auth-group; one cannot use
both in a single target.
.It Ic chap Ao Ar user Ac Aq Ar secret
Specifies CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that targets must use either auth-group, or chap,
or chap-mutual clauses; it's a configuration error to mix them in one target.
.It Ic chap-mutual Ao Ar user Ac Ao Ar secret Ac Ao Ar mutualuser Ac Aq Ar mutualsecret
Specifies mutual CHAP authentication credentials.
Note that targets must use either auth-group, chap, or
chap-mutual clauses; it's a configuration error to mix them in one target.
.It Ic initiator-name Ao Ar initiator-name Ac
Specifies iSCSI initiator name.
If not defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator
name.
Otherwise, only initiators with names matching one of defined
ones will be allowed to connect.
This clause is mutually exclusive with auth-group; one cannot use
both in a single target.
.It Ic initiator-portal Ao Ar address Ac Ao Ar / prefixlen Ac
Specifies the iSCSI initiator portal: an IPv4 or IPv6 address, optionally
followed by slash and prefix length.
If not defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator
address.
Otherwise, only initiators with addresses matching one of defined
ones will be allowed to connect.
This clause is mutually exclusive with auth-group; one cannot use
both in a single target.
.It Ic portal-group Ar name Op Ar agname
Assign a previously defined portal group to the target.
The default portal group is
.Qq Ar default ,
which makes the target available
on TCP port 3260 on all configured IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
Optional second argument specifies auth group name for connections
to this specific portal group.
If second argument is not specified, target auth group is used.
.It Ic port Ar name
.It Ic port Ar name/pp
.It Ic port Ar name/pp/vp
Assign specified CTL port (such as "isp0" or "isp2/1") to the target.
On startup ctld configures LUN mapping and enables all assigned ports.
Each port can be assigned to only one target.
.It Ic redirect Aq Ar address
IPv4 or IPv6 address to redirect initiators to.
When configured, all initiators attempting to connect to this target
will get redirected using "Target moved temporarily" login response.
Redirection happens after successful authentication.
.It Ic lun Ar number Ar name
Export previously defined
.Sy lun
by the parent target.
.It Ic lun Ar number
Create a
.Sy lun
configuration context, defining a LUN exported by the parent target.
.El
.Ss lun level
The following statements are available at the lun level:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic backend Ao Ar block | Ar ramdisk Ac
Specifies the CTL backend to use for a given LUN.
Valid choices are
.Dq block
and
.Dq ramdisk ;
block is used for LUNs backed
by files or disk device nodes; ramdisk is a bitsink device, used mostly for
testing.
The default backend is block.
.It Ic blocksize Aq Ar size
Specifies blocksize visible to the initiator.
The default blocksize is 512.
.It Ic device-id Ar string
The SCSI Device Identification string presented to the initiator.
.It Ic option Ar name Ar value
The CTL-specific options passed to the kernel.
All CTL-specific options are documented in the
.Sx OPTIONS
section of
.Xr ctladm 8 .
.It Ic path Ar path
The path to the file, device node, or
.Xr zfs 8
volume used to back the LUN.
For optimal performance, create the volume with the
.Qq Ar volmode=dev
property set.
.It Ic serial Ar string
The SCSI serial number presented to the initiator.
.It Ic size Ar size
The LUN size, in bytes.
.El
